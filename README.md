# AIM
To read the given data and perform data cleaning and save the cleaned data to a file.

# Algorithm
STEP 1: Read the given Data

STEP 2: Get the information about the data

STEP 3: Remove the null values from the data

STEP 4: Save the Clean data to the file

STEP 5: Remove outliers using IQR

STEP 6: Use zscore of to remove outliers

# Result
Thus we have cleaned the data and removed the outliers by detection using IQR
 and Z-score method.
